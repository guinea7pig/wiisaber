# Style
Here are the standard requirements that should be kept:
- 8 Tab space
- More to come

# Boilerplate credits text
I would like to keep a boilerplate credits text at the start of the file,
kind of reminiscent of the Linux kernel comment headers. Here is the general
structure we should strive to keep (in order)

### Filename
Self explanatory.

### Purpose
Try to keep it to one sentence. If it's a header, also put where the function definitions are.

### Credits
Here is the general information for the credits:
- Name(s), can be set to user name for anomynity
- Date written/committed (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Contact information (optional)
Have it like:
```
- Date, Name, (contact)
```
